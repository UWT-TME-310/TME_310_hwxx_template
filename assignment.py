    ## Validation and Reflection
    
    ### Validation Checklist
    - [ ] Units are correct and consistent
    - [ ] Results are physically reasonable
    - [ ] Code handles edge cases appropriately
    - [ ] Compared to analytical solution (if available)
    
    ### Reflection Questions
    1. What was the most challenging aspect?
    2. How did AI assistance help your understanding?
    3. What would you do differently next time?
